We'll go down a list of creating and editing, rolling back, then deleting a project.

1.) ./WTF configure <IPAddress> <PORT>
	- 8000 <= PORT <= 65535
		- ./WTF confgure localhost 5000 - expected: error, received: error
		- ./WTF configure localhost 70000 - expected: error, received: error
		- ./WTF confiure localhost 40000 - expected: worked, result: worked


	-- Just testing the checkout
2.) ./WTF checkout <project name>
	- testproj exists on server
		- ./WTF checkout testproj - expected: Project to be sent to client, results: Project was indeed sent to the client with proper print messages.
		- ./WTF checkout nope - expected: Error saying project doesn't exist. Result: Project doesn't exist message.


3.) ./WTF create proj
	- Expect the server to create the project, then the client to create the same project and store the .Manifest into the client.
	- Calling the command does indeed accomplish this, printing out the appropriate messages.

4.) Next I will create 3 files, file1.txt and file2.txt, file3.txt but file2.txt will be in another directory. I will use the ./WTF add command to add them to the manifest. Then the remove command to remove file3.txt from the manifest.

	- ./WTF add proj proj/file1.txt
	- ./WTF add proj proj/dir/file2.txt
	- ./WTF add proj proj/file3.txt

	- the resulting manifest is as follows: 
		1
		1 proj/file1.txt c18d547cafb43e30a993439599bd08321bea17bfedbe28b13bce8a7f298b63a2
		1 proj/dir/file2.txt 79308fea7eb702a9e142832f5eb4995ae227d9a5d3a9e6f4239bffdef88b0472
		1 proj/file3.txt e3b0c44298fc1c149afbf4c8996fb92427ae41e4649b934ca495991b7852b855

	- Now I will remove file3.txt, and the resulting manifest is now:
		1
		1 proj/file1.txt c18d547cafb43e30a993439599bd08321bea17bfedbe28b13bce8a7f298b63a2
		1 proj/dir/file2.txt 79308fea7eb702a9e142832f5eb4995ae227d9a5d3a9e6f4239bffdef88b0472

	- Tested add and remove with files that didn't exist. Received the correct errors.

5.) Now lets push these changes to the server.
	- ./WTF commit proj
	- I expect to see to 'A' codes. Here is what prints out to the console:
		A 2 proj/file1.txt c18d547cafb43e30a993439599bd08321bea17bfedbe28b13bce8a7f298b63a2
		A 2 proj/dir/file2.txt 79308fea7eb702a9e142832f5eb4995ae227d9a5d3a9e6f4239bffdef88b0472

	- now lets push these changes to the server. This should delete the .commits everywhere, compress the previous directory, and update history. 
	- Results: as expected.
